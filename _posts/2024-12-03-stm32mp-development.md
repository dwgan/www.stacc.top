In this project, we explored the advantage of STM32MPU to design powerful development platform with lower price. The STM32MP157 is a heterogeneous system architecture with an A7 core and an M4 core. The A7 core can run a Linux system and execute high-performance tasks such as human-machine interfaces (HMI), video encoding/decoding, and providing USB and Ethernet interfaces. The M4 core can run real-time tasks such as motor control and sensor data acquisition. <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/posts/stm32mp-development/">Learn more about STM32MP Development</a>
