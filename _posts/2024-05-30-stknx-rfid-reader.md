One of serials that we recently focus on is STKNX. KNX is a international standard protocol in smart home automation field, which provides a full standard from physical layer to application layer. The full standard allow easy use without considering the compatibility of the products, realizing plug and play.

RFID is one of the most widely used radio frequency communication technologies today, playing an important role in areas such as payment and security. We aim to integrate it into smart industrial and smart home applications. Our team has provided a demo that showcases RFID communication and serves as a reference solution for smart industrial and smart home systems, primarily based on ST's microchips.
