Green energy usage is a key topic in industrial development. Solar energy, as a form of green energy, is versatile and convenient for use, ranging from personal electronics to industrial devices, from basic equipment such as streetlights to outer space technologies.

In certain specific environments, such as areas lit by incandescent bulbs indoors, the light is too weak to be effectively harvested for energy. A practical and cost-effective solution would be highly beneficial, such as developing advanced light-harvesting technologies that can efficiently convert low-intensity indoor lighting into usable energy. This approach could enable sustainable energy usage in indoor environments and other areas with limited light sources.

The SPV1050 is an ultra-low power and high-efficiency power manager embedding four MOSFETs for boost or buck-boost DC-DC converter and an additional transistor for the load connection/disconnection. An internal high accuracy MPPT algorithm can be used to maximize the power extracted from PV panel or TEG. The internal logic works to guarantee tight monitoring of both the end-of-charge voltage (VEOC) and the minimum battery voltage (VUVP) by opening the pass-transistor at triggering of the VEOC threshold or at triggering of the VUVP threshold to preserve the battery life.
